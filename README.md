## Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project was part of The Odin Project to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

** This is an update to the original Rock, Paper, Scissors in the main branch. This new branch contains refactored functions, a UI was built, and the player now makes their choice using buttons. **

A random number generator is used to determine the opponent's choice. The player types in their choice. Then the code needs to determine who is the winner after one round. The final step is to declare a winner after 5 rounds. 

The game consists of using alerts to let the player know who won.
